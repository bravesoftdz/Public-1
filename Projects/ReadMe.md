## DialEdit
A Designer for Dialogs for TurboVision and FreeVision

## FV+ (FV.p)
A modified Version of FreeVision able to be compiled in objFPC-Mode

## FV2
The start of a next-gen FreeVision
with following design-principles:
- Using classes instead of objects
- classes are Unit-Tested as much as possible
- Using procedure-delegates for dialog events instead of message-numbers
- enumerators instead of callback
- minimal hardware-dependency 

## IDE+ (IDE.p)
A modified Version of FP (the IDE), able to be compiled in objFPC-Mode
Thanks to MarcoV it is the orginal IDE with the addition of a Project-Info-File.
This makes it possible to compile/debug it in Lazarus.

## Stemma+ (Stemma.p)
A modified Version of Stemma from François Marchi
